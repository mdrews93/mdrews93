    "Previously, the stats from a single player were downloaded and populated in a dictionary. The next step is retrieving the stats for each player on the team. I worked on this a couple months ago about halfway through our season and ended up going to each individual player's webpage, copying and pasting their stats into a file on my computer and manually adding commas. I did this for each player and then the python script that created the dictionary iterated through all 11 files to get the stats. \n",
    "# YUCK!!\n",
    "\n",
    "What a terrible approach. Granted, I was just trying to quickly put a plot together for my coaches, but I should've put a little bit more thought into the script. Once we played more games, if I wanted an updated plot, I would have to repeat the entire process of copying and pasting the stats. By retrieving the data directly through the site's HTML, no additional work is required if more games are added.\n",

    "Anyways, onto the python. I'll repeat the vital code from the previous post. In the future, I'll likely create modules with functions in them to keep the notebooks clean."
