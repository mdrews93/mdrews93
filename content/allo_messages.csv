The group interview goes from 9:30-11:00 and then the individual one would go from like 12:30-3:00 I think he said. I get $160 no matter what for the group interview and I get a free $25 just for agreeing to be a backup. If I do the individual interview, that'd be an extra $175.

"Brian K","I had a student come to my drop in tutoring at 12:36 (ends at 12:50) and she was like a bit snobby and rude-seeming and I was about to flip shit 
My good friend who is a Spanish professor recommended me to her which I appreciate but like ugh
Anyway, she ended up being okay and pretty nice and pretty decent with the material. She was 17, apparently. Little diva light-skinned black girl, to be racist lol 
I had been working with a student I've been working with all semester who basically has LD's and extreme difficulties and is taking Spanish for pass or fail which is Bs Idk why but I like her as a person lol anyway it was just annoying that this girl rudely abruptly interrupted us and didn't acknowledge like anything so I was like fill this form out bitch and slow your roll ok
Tysm ILYSM 

Also have a student who has seen me once or twice this semester for French and he randomly scheduled an appointment for today and I'm like wtf how is he passing still like wtf do you need tutoring for randomly

"Michael","It's about 25% of what I made","16","1491361036144","text/plain"
"Michael","lol fuck you google. It's right around $1500. There will be a credit of probably ~$1000 so that at least brings it down to $500.

"Michael","Hey Lou!

Sorry I missed your call earlier; I was tutoring and then I had a class. Since it's already pretty late in the day, I don't want to bother you at home with a call so I'll just briefly run through my summer plans in this email for you to take a look at when you get the chance. Then when you have a moment I'd like to continue the discussion via phone. 

I've budgeted out all of my expenses for the next year and I'd really have to make at least $22 an hour as an independent contractor in order to get by next year. I recognize that that may seem to be a significant increase and I understand if that pay rate can't be accommodated, but with my current financial situation I am in need of a higher pay to keep up with my expenses. 

Of course my financial situation isn't reason enough for a raise, but considering my level of expertise, education, and contributions to the platform, I believe that I've earned a raise in pay.  

Now I really do believe in EQ and I love working on the platform, so I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement to continue that work into the summer!

I'll be available for a phone call anytime tonight and then anytime tomorrow after 4:00pm, so send a call my way at your convenience.

Thanks Lou!

A:¬†Yes. Members are limited to¬†three¬†copies of a new (i.e. not pre-owned) gaming software title per platform, per year. Collector‚Äôs and Limited Editions count toward that title limit. Game of the Year editions, usually released much later including additional content do not count toward that limit but would essentially start as a separate game and limit."","16","1489108018415","text/plain"

"Ginny","Aurora is amazing lol they are super planners like I am :P ","16","1489090287272","text/plain"
"Michael","I don't even know the class list for fall lol","16","1489090268956","text/plain"
"Ginny","Right ","16","1489090267339","text/plain"
"Michael","Oh and you're talking about Spring.","16","1489090260552","text/plain"
"Michael","My schedule can be whatever I want whenever I want basically lol","16","1489090234786","text/plain"
"Ginny","I guess this largely will depend on your schedule as well though since you and I will be sharing the car and needing to drive/drop one another off at different times and places ","16","1489089153422","text/plain"
"Ginny","Sorry for dumping all this on you lol ","16","1489089119073","text/plain"
"Ginny","maybe I should just keep the Tuesday Thursday 9:15-3 schedule (option 1). I'm done early enough to go and work so it should be fine ","16","1489088395893","text/plain"
"Ginny","So for spring, if I wanna keep the same thing for my internship schedule of Monday Wednesday Thursday I would need to do the Tuesday/8-week Saturday class schedule option ","16","1489088208058","text/plain"
"Ginny","For the fall my schedule is perfect, I have Tuesday all day in class and just Thursday evening. So my internship schedule I'm hoping will be Monday Wednesday and Thursdays so Friday I have wide open and can work or do homework or whatever ","16","1489088160464","text/plain"
"Ginny","Well the first option is what I currently have...I have no idea anymore lol ","16","1489088108557","text/plain"
"Michael","Which do you prefer between the other two options?","16","1489088030690","text/plain"
"Ginny","Lmao okay ü§£","16","1489087974633","text/plain"
"Michael","Eff that option lol","16","1489087958195","text/plain"
"Ginny","Yeah, so basically I'd have a Saturday class for the full 16 weeks of the semester","16","1489087927561","text/plain"
"Michael","The second option had Saturday classes all semester?","0","1489087886831","text/plain"
"Ginny","So there's 3 options: 

16 weeks of Tuesday and Thursday classes from 9:15-3

16 weeks of Tuesday classes from 9:15-3 and two 8 week classes on a Saturday from 9am-3pm

16 weeks of Tuesdays from 9:15-3 and 6:30-8pm and just one 8 week Saturday class from 9-3pm (so last 8 weeks of the semester are open)","16","1489087799082","text/plain"
"Ginny","Lol sorry, I'm not explaining it well, let me try again..So another option is have 3 classes on Tuesday for 16 weeks, and take one class on a Saturday for just 8 weeks. So the remaining 8 weeks of the semester my Saturdays would be open. ","16","1489087627206","text/plain"
"Michael","I don't really follow that last message","16","1489087535434","text/plain"
"Michael","It's up to you lol it's early enough where you'd still have all of your Saturday though so it wouldn't be too bad.","16","1489087521588","text/plain"
"Ginny","So no to Saturday classes? Another alternative is what you had kinda thought earlier actually. I could do 9:15-3 and then take a class from 6-8:30 on Tuesdays for 16 weeks and just take one 8 week Saturday session","16","1489087462849","text/plain"
"Michael","I'd lean towards taking the 16 week version so you have your Saturdays","16","1489087354997","text/plain"
"Ginny","Yes right ","16","1489087326858","text/plain"
"Michael","Yeah, so you would only ever have 3 classes.","16","1489087296332","text/plain"
"Ginny","So the first 8 weeks of the semester I'd do the one class and it would be done in 8 weeks. Then the next 8 weeks I'd start a new 8 week class. Does that make sense?","16","1489086445396","text/plain"
"Ginny","No no, so I have 4 classes I have to take in total. I'd have 2 classes on Tuesdays continuing for 16 weeks. Then I'd take one class for the first 8 week term and my second class for the second 8 week term.","16","1489086357334","text/plain"
"Michael","So if you did the 16 week option, you'd have one class for the first 8 weeks and two for the second 8 weeks?","16","1489086290547","text/plain"
"Ginny","I feel like it probably wouldn't be that bad though cuz I'm done by 3pm on Saturday so I could still go out or work that evening...And I can designate another free day to my internship ","16","1489085850299","text/plain"
"Ginny","Yeah, I'm kinda thinking that too...So here's the thing though, it would really be a full 16 weeks though cuz id take one class the first 8 and my other class the next 8 weeks. ","16","1489085798225","text/plain"
"Michael","Hmm... Personally I think I'd prefer taking the Saturday class. It'll be a tough 8 weeks but then the last 8 weeks would be much easier","0","1489085731142","text/plain"
"Ginny","^","16","1489085725260","text/plain"
"Ginny","Does that work for you?","16","1489085719829","text/plain"
"Ginny","So either I keep my schedule as is with 2 classes on Tuesdays and 2 on Thursdays from 9:15-3 over 16 weeks or I do 2 classes on Tuesdays from 9:15-3 and take one class for 8 weeks on Saturdays from 9-3 and immediately take the next class on the same time and day for the remaining 8 weeks of the 16 week semester ","16","1489085637092","text/plain"
"Ginny","Good plan! 
So this is for next spring semester, the courses I'm considering are required courses. Right now my schedule would be Tuesday and Thursday from 9:15-3pm I'd have class. What I potentially could do is keep the 2 classes I have on Tuesday and take the Thursday classes on a Saturday in an 8-week format versus 16 week. ","16","1489085531334","text/plain"
"Michael","Yeah, I should be able to cover all of the material by 6:25. I'm gonna stay on campus and get some chicken fingers for lunch. And what's the class for? Is it part of your program? Is it required or taught at any other time?","0","1489085408077","text/plain"

"Michael","Even programming!! Eventually they'll be able to program themselves. That's even kinda what I'm learning with machine learning‚Äã.

"Ginny","Yeah definitely not lol for Psych I can see that though. And I can see on some level how a computer could diagnose based on the DSM criteria alone, but there's too many other variables which can negate the DSM though ","16","1488907889317","text/plain"

Man, when we almost went to IHOP in boystown, I secretly wanted to go in so we would get hit on and I would handle the situation accordingly and coincidentally you would know I am poo 

When I told you I've been to Fantasy and knew about it, it was hinting at "it". That's my favorite club in boystown. I've been to boystown more than I've seen you people in my entire life. Okay probably not. Lol. But I haven't gone in a long time. We gotta go ASAP! Boystown is not quite my favorite place, but it can be fun. For some reason (music, people,
Atmosphere), I am drawn to predominantly "straight" clubs which are the ones I'm always telling you guys about.

I've been to pride parade once. I remember I missed one because I was in Missouri and Justin and Katie felt the traffic because of it and I was like üò≥.... the first and only year I went, I went withsome of my best gay friends, who I'm not close with anymore.

Again, sorry this had to be over STUPID ASS ALLO!!!! But ya know, it was an accident and a blessing in disguise. Oopsies !! ","16","1486184291364","text/plain"
"Ginny","Okay. So you would know and you like the people that are invited?","16","1486184283265","text/plain"
"Brian K","Ok, so I am so sorry.... That was a stupid mistake of me to send that copy and paste message, lmfao. I didn't intend to have that included, but I totally forgot about it. I was so angry about what happened that I didn't bother to read what I was sending. Anyway, I never wanted it to be this way... I wanted to do it in person, but I never quite got a comfortable chance. I know you guys don't give a fuck and knew at least somewhat and I just never came around to it.... It's been extremely difficult in some regard. I have always known that you guys are there for me and are my closest cousins and are open-minded intellectuals... I don't even know what to say. I'm not gonna disregard it. Now is the time! This has been a blessing in disguise. I'm not gonna play it off anymore, because I can be myself completely with you guys, there was just always this chunk missing. So yes, I'm confirming this to you guys, but it was purely by accident. Nonetheless, it's a good thing. It's a BIG something off my shoulders. I did it before turning 22, yay! But I still have a long way to go... I trust you guys will keep this between us and will be a little more careful with your ""faggot/gay/queer" usage (you fucking BETCHES) But yeah this is never what I planned but we are all mature and amazing enough to love each other and confirm whatever it is that I am confirming. My baptism or something? I forgot. If you guys have questions or concerns (I'm being dead serious), please, don't hesitate to ask or whatever. There's a LOT to catch up on, and learn about me. Part of my life has been hidden to many for 5+ years. And I apologize I never came around sooner. You never know how it is unless you're in the shoes :/. Anyway if the bitch knew I'm gay she probably would've been like omfg YAS WERK HONEY BOO BOO BITCH

"Brian K","Ok, so I am so sorry.... That was a stupid mistake of me to send that copy and paste message, lmfao. I didn't intend to have that included, but I totally forgot about it. I was so angry about what happened that I didn't bother to read what I was sending. Anyway, I never wanted it to be this way... I wanted to do it in person, but I never quite got a comfortable chance. I know you guys don't give a fuck and knew at least somewhat and I just never came around to it.... It's been extremely difficult in some regard. I have always known that you guys are there for me and are my closest cousins and are open-minded intellectuals... I don't even know what to say. I'm not gonna disregard it. Now is the time! This has been a blessing in disguise. I'm not gonna play it off anymore, because I can be myself completely with you guys, there was just always this chunk missing. So yes, I'm confirming this to you guys, but it was purely by accident. Nonetheless, it's a good thing. It's a BIG something off my shoulders. I did it before turning 22, yay! But I still have a long way to go... I trust you guys will keep this between us and will be a little more careful with your ""faggot/gay/queer" usage (you fucking BETCHES) But yeah this is never what I planned but we are all mature and amazing enough to love each other and confirm whatever it is that I am confirming. My baptism or something? I forgot. If you guys have questions or concerns (I'm being dead serious), please, don't hesitate to ask or whatever. There's a LOT to catch up on, and learn about me. Part of my life has been hidden to many for 5+ years. And I apologize I never came around sooner. You never know how it is unless you're in the shoes :/. Anyway if the bitch knew I'm gay she probably would've been like omfg YAS WERK HONEY BOO BOO BITCH

Death is here and near 

I'm sad because I found out that I'm not going to Puerto Rico. I misunderstood lolli. I thought she said her mom would cover the majority of the trip, but apparently she can only cover airfare. Everything else would cost 800-1,000 (hotel, food, activities, etc) I can't afford that. It's only a 3-4 day trip in the capital. I felt stressed because she said I needed to make a decision today but I found out this very important information so I was feeling pressured but now I know I can't and it's ok but I'm sad but maybe I'll go somewhere spring break or summer with her idk (the trip is for her bday) I will travel the world. Aunt sue could afford that but I'm not gonna ask and it's apparently too late to ask anyway 

I need to talk to A coworker Tysm ILYSM
